## Directions

### Windows

Follow the direcdtory to `src/VulkanFinal/` to see relevant files for the final project.

On W10, assuming you are using VS community, make sure you create a `Windows Desktop Wizard` Project, and that `Console Application` is selected as type. Make sure once you make your new project, you configure your libraries by adding additional include directories for dependencies (GLM, GLFW, stb_img and tinyobjloader) and add as necessary.

Next, also make sure you add appropriate library directories and include vulkan-1.lib and glfw3.lib as additiona libraries.

Finally, make sure that the C++ language standard is set to C++17.

Then you can compile and run!
